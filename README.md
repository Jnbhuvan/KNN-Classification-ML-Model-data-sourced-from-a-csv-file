# KNN Classification from CSV Data

This project demonstrates a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification model applied to data loaded from a CSV file.  
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and walks through the entire ML workflow â€” from loading the dataset to evaluating the model.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
1. Load and explore a dataset from a CSV file.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize if needed).
3. Train a **KNN classifier**.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and other metrics.
5. Visualize results (optional, depending on dataset).

This serves as a simple, beginner-friendly **machine learning example** that can be extended for more advanced classification tasks.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn sklearn
